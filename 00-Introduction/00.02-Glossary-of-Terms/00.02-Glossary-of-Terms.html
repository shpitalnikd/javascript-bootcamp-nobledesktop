      // An array is a type of object that store data as numbered list items.
      // The syntax is to put the values, which can be of any datatype, inside of square brackets.
      // Items are referenced by their numeric position, known as the **index**, which start numbering at 0.

      let fruits = ["kiwi", "pear", "plum"];
      console.log(fruits[0]); // kiwi

      // boolean
      // A variable or value that can be only true or false.
      // Conditional logic resolves to a boolean:

      let isOnline = true;
      isOnline = false;
      console.log(isOnline);

      // condition

      // A condition is something that is evaluated and resolves to true or false.
      // Conditions are found in loops and in if-else statements (conditional logic).
      // The condition of a loop must be true for the loop's code block to execute.
      // In this example, the condition is **x < 10**.
      // If the condition is true, the code inside the {} will run:

      let x = 9;
      if (x < 10) {
        x++;
      }
      console.log(x);

      // dot syntax
      // The use of dots to access or "drill down into" objects is
      // known as dot syntax:

      const triStates = {
        ct: {
          nickname: "Constitutino State",
          capitol: "Hartford",
        },
        nj: {
          nickname: "Garden State",
          capitol: "Trenton",
        },
        ny: {
          motnicknameto: "Empire State",
          capitol: "Albany",
        },
      };

      console.log(triStates.ny.capitol); //  Albany
      console.log(triStates.ny); // {nickname: "Empire State", capitol: "Albany"}
      console.log(triStates.nj.motto); //  Garden State
      console.log(triStates.nj); // {nickname: "Garden State", capitol: "Trenton"}

      // else
      // Conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements:
      // if a condition is true, do something; else do something else:

      x = 2;
      if (x > 3) {
        console.log("The condition is true!");
      } else {
        console.log("The condition is false!");
      }

      // for loop

      // A for loop executes a block of code again and again,
      // as long as a condition is true. The condition must become
      // false eventually, or else the loop never ends and is called
      // an infinite loop.
      // A for loop considers three pieces of information between
      // its parentheses in order to decide if it will run the code
      // inside its curly braces: a counter, a condition and
      // an incrementer:

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i * i); // 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
      }

      // function
      // A function is a block of code that runs only when it is
      // invoked (called). The function can be called in the code
      // or by an event on the web page, such as a button click.
      // A function usually (but not always) has a name to call it by:

      function greetUser(name) {
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
      }

      greetUser("Brian"); // Hello, Brian!

      // function scope / local scope
      // Function scope / local scope refers to variables that are
      // available only inside the function in which they are defined.
      // Also see scope, global scope and local scope.

      // global/ window object
      // The highest level object in JS is the global window object,
      // the direct children of which include the document,
      // console, navigation and history objects. The window object
      // is assumed and need not be referenced:

      alert("Hello!");
      // or:
      window.alert("Hello again!");

      // global sscope, global memory

      // Global scope / memory refers to variables that are
      // declared at the level of the global object and as such
      // are avaialable throughout a script, as opposed to being
      // confined to the scope of a particular code block.
      // Also see scope, function scope and local scope.
      // In this example x is global because it is declared outside
      // of any code block, but i is scoped to the for loop,
      // and so is not available outside the code block.
      // Attempts to reference it result in "ERROR not defined".

      x = 5; // global variable

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }

      console.log(x); // 5
      // console.log(i); // ERROR i is not defined

      // history object
      // A direct child of the window, the history object has
      // methods pertaining to the browser history. Although the
      // window part is optional, it is customary to include window
      // when referencing the history object:

      // reload the last visited browser page
      window.history.back();

      // if-else logic, if-statement
      // The logic of decision making in programming,
      // conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements:
      // if a condition is true, do something; else do something else:

      x = 10;
      let y = 3;

      if (x > y) {
        console.log("x is greater than y!");
      } else {
        console.log("x is equal to or less than y!");
      }

      // index
      // The position number of an item in an array,
      // with the first item at index 0:

      let froots = ["kiwi", "pear", "plum"];
      console.log(froots[0]); // kiwi

      // key
      // The name of a property is called the key.
      // This object has keys of name, age and retired:

      let guy = {
        name: "Bob",
        age: 40,
        retired: false,
      };

      // length
      // Called on an array, the length property returns the number
      // of items in the array:

      let fru = ["kiwi", "pear", "plum"];
      console.log(fru.length); // 3

      // let
      // The let keyword is for declaring block-scoped variables,
      // meaning that the variables only exist inside the curly
      // braces in which they are declared. In this example,
      // power is declared in the global scope and so is
      // available everywhere in the script. But i and cube are
      // declared inside the for loop, which makes them
      // block scoped, so NOT available in the global scope:

      let power = 3;

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        let cube = i ** power;
        console.log(cube);
      }

      console.log(power); // 3
      // console.log(i); // ERROR cube is not defined
      // console.log(cube); // ERROR cube is not defined

      // loop
      // A loop is a programming routine that executes a block of
      // code again and again, as long as a condition is true.
      // There are a few kinds of loops in JS, including "for loops"
      // and "while loops":

      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i ** 4); // 1, 16. 81, 625 ... 10000
      }

      // methods

      // Methods are the verbs of programming languages-—they do stuff;
      // they perform actions. Just as verbs go together with nouns,
      // methods are attached to objects.
      // Methods perform a myriad of tasks: output content to html
      // elements, load data from the server, play sounds, create
      // new html elements, and so on.
      // Dot-syntax is how we access the methods of a JS object.
      // First comes the object, followed by a dot. Then comes the
      // method. So it goes object-dot-method:

      let dateTime = new Date();
      // the Date object's getHours() method:
      let hour = dateTime.getHours();
      // the console's log method:
      console.log(hour); // integer in 0-23 range

      // modulo
      // The modulo operator, symbol % returns the remainder when
      // one number is divided by another:

      console.log(15 % 4); // 3

      // nesting
      // Nesting refers to something inside of another similar thing,
      // such as a loop inside of a loop, a block of conditional
      // logic (if-statement inside) conditional logic, or an array
      // inside of an array:

      // nested for loop: a loop inside a loop
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
          console.log(i ** j); // i to the j power
        }
      }

      // nested if-else:
      let weather = "cloudy";
      let windy = true;

      if (weather == "cloudy") {
        console.log("Go to the park");
        if (windy) {
          console.log("Fly a kite");
        } else {
          console.log("Have a picnic");
        }
      }

      // objects
      // Objects are variables that can store more than one value at
      // a time. They are divided broadly into Objects, per se, and a type of object called an Array. Objects proper store data inside curly braces as *properties*, consisting of name-value (key-value) pairs: name:

      let kat = {
        name: "Fluffy",
        age: 4,
        cute: true,
      };

      // property
      // A property is a name-value (key-value pair) that belongs to
      // -- is scoped to -- an object. As such, a property is
      // essentially a local variable. The properties of an object
      // can be nested. Properties are accessed by means od dot
      // syntax:

      let cat = {
        name: "Fluffy",
        age: 4,
        cute: true,
        owner: {
          name: "Bob",
          age: 40,
          job: "Programmer",
        },
      };
      console.log(cat.name); // Fluffy
      console.log(cat.owner.name); // Bob
      console.log(cat.age); // 4
      console.log(cat.owner.age); // 40
      console.log(cat.cute); // true
      console.log(cat.owner.cute); // undefined
      console.log(cat.job); // undefined
      console.log(cat.owner.job); // Programmer

      // return value
      // Think of a function as an input-output machine, with the
      // arguments being the input and the **return** value being
      // the output. A return value "exports" the function result
      // for use elsewhere. In order to "capture" the return value,
      // set the function call equal to a variable:

      function addNums(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }

      let sum1 = addNums(5, 6);
      console.log(sum1); // 11

      let sum2 = addNums(8, 9);
      console.log(sum2); // 17

      // string
      // Pure text in quotes is a string. Setting a variable equal
      // to a string gives the variable a data type of string:

      let firstName = "Brian";
      console.log(firstName, typeof firstName); // Brian string

      // ternary
      // A ternary expression is a concise, one-line alternative to
      // an else-if statement. It uses ? and : instead of if()
      // and else, while also dispensing with the curly braces:

      x = 5;

      // if x is less than 10, add 1; else set x equal to 0:
      if (x < 10) {
        x++;
      } else {
        x = 0;
      }

      // ternary version of the above:
      x < 10 ? x++ : (x = 0);

      // var
      // The var keyword for declaring variables has largely been
      // supplanted by let due to the greater control over variable
      // scope provided by the latter. A var declared inside the
      // curly braces of a loop or if-statement are in the global
      // scope, whereas let variables declared inside the curly
      // braces of a loop or if-statement are scoped to that code
      // block:

      // j exists outside the loop, because it is declared with var:
      for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        console.log(j ** 2); // j squared
      }
      console.log(j); // 5

      // i exists ONLY inside the loop, because it is declared with let:
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(i ** 2); // i squared
      }
      // console.log(i); // ERROR: i is not undefined

      // while
      // A while loop is a kind of loop. Unlike a for loop,
      // which has the counter, condition and incrementer inside
      // parentheses, a while loop has these elements scattered
      // about, with the counter declared above the loop, the
      // conditon evaluated inside parentheses, and the incrementer
      // inside the curly braces. In general, use a for loop if you
      // know exactly how many times you want the loop to run, and
      // use a while loop if the number of iterations is not
      // pre-determined:

      let frutes = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi", "orange", "pear"];

      // using a for loop, because the number of iterations is known:
      for (let i = 0; i < frutes.length; i++) {
        console.log(frutes[i] + " has " + frutes[i].length + " letters!");
      }

      // using a while loop because the number of iterations is not
      // known; the loop ends with the first 4-letter item, but its
      // index may not be known.

      let n = 0;
      while (frutes[n].length != 4) {
        console.log(frutes[n] + " is " + frutes[n].length + " letters long!");
        n++;
      }

      /* the for loop will run 6 times as it fully traverses the array, but the while loop will only run 3 times, because it will quit when the condition is false, which occurs when the current item is 'kiwi'.
apple has 5 letters!
banana has 6 letters!
grape has 5 letters!
kiwi has 4 letters!
orange has 6 letters!
pear has 4 letters!
apple is 5 letters long!
banana is 6 letters long!
grape is 5 letters long!
