### resoloving nested quotes

**resolving conflicting nested quotes**

Strings can go in either double or single quotes, but nested quotes can cause problems.

1. Declare a string in single quotes with an internal single quote (apostrophe). Check the console. There's an error:

```
    let song = 'Won't Get Fooled Again';
    // Unexpected identifier 't'
```

**unexpected identified**

An **unexpected identifier**, also known as an **unexpected token**, is a character that doesn't belong. The problem is, the apostrophe was mistaken for the end of the string, which makes 'Won' the entire string--and everything else 'unexpected'.

**mixing-and-matching quotes**

If you have an inner single quote (apostrophe), avoid conflicts by wrapping the string in double quotes.

2. Resolve the nested quote conflict by switching to double quotes:

```
    let song = "Won't Get Fooled Again";
    console.log(song); // Won't Get Fooled Again
```

**escaping quotes**

Instead of mixing-and-matching quotes, you can "escape quotes" with a backslash, which causes the punctuation to be ignored.

3. Declare another variable with single quotes (apostrophes) nested inside single quotes, and then fix the error by escaping the apostrophes:

```
    // let song2 = 'Don't Stop Believin''; // error
    let song2 = 'Don\'t Stop Believin\'';
    console.log(song2);
```

**string interpolation**

Long string concatenation can get hard to read, with all its quote and plus-signs. A cleaner alternative is **string interpolation**, which doesn't have any quotes or plus signs. To convert concatenation to interpolation, follow these steps:

- Delete all quotes and plus signs.
- Wrap everything in a pair of backticks \*\* \*\*.
- Put variables in curly braces, preceded by a dollar sign: **${variable}**

4. Do a string concatenation and then switch to string iterpolation:

```
    // string concatenation
    let firstName = 'Bob';
    let greeting = 'Hi, ' + firstName + '! How are you?';
    console.log(greeting); // Hi, Bob! How are you?

    // string iterpolation
    greeting = Hi, ${firstName}! How are you?;
    console.log(greeting); // Hi, Bob! How are you?
```

The advantage of string interpolation is more apparent when there are multiple variables and substrings.

5. Declare a few more variables and make a longer, more complex concatenation:

```
    let petName = "Fluffy";
    let age = 3;
    let food = "tuna";

    let catGreeting = "Meow! My name is " + petName + "! I am " + age + " years old. My favorite food is " + food + ".";

    console.log(catGreeting);
    // Meow! My name is Fluffy! I am 3 years old. My favorite food is tuna.
```

This concatenation has four pairs of quotes and six plus signs, making it hard to read and write.

6. Refactor the above as string interpolation:

```
    catGreeting = `Meow! My name is ${petName}. I am ${age} years old. My favorite food is ${food}`;

    console.log(catGreeting);
    // Meow! My name is Fluffy! I am 3 years old. My favorite food is tuna.
```

**line breaks and tabs**

With string concatenation, hitting enter to get a line break is ignored, as are tabs.

7. Do a string concatenation with line breaks and tabs:

```
    let item1 = 'eggs';
    let item2 = 'bread';
    let item3 = 'milk';
    let shoppingList = 'Shopping List:' +
        item1 +
        item2 +
        item3;
    console.log(shoppingList);
    // Shopping List:eggsbreadmilk
```

8. Try it with string interpolation. Now, hitting enter gives you a line break in the output. Tab works too:

```
    shoppingList = `Shopping List:
        ${item1}
        ${item2}
        ${item3}`;
    console.log(shoppingList);
    /*
    Shopping List:
        eggs
        bread
        milk
    */
```

The line breaks and tabs can be done with regular concatenation:

- **\n** in string concatenation gives a line break.
- **\t** in string concatenation gives a tabs.

9. Try the shopping list with regular string concatenation, including the line breaks and tabs. It can be done, but is a pain to write, so feel free to copy-paste this one:

```
    shoppingList = "Shopping List: \n\t" + item1 + "\n\t" + item2 + "\n\t" + item3;
    console.log(shoppingList);
    /*
    Shopping List:
        eggs
        bread
        milk
    */
```

**const means constant**

- A **variable** is a named value that can _vary_ (change).
- A **constant** is a named value that _cannot_ be changed.

Constants, by convention, have UPPERCASE names, but an all-caps name alone does not make for a constant. Below, **let MOON_DIAMETER** is uppercase, but you can still change the value.

10. Declare an uppercase variable with **let**:

```
    let MOON_DIAMETER = 2159.1;
    console.log(MOON_DIAMETER); // 2159.1
    MOON_DIAMETER *= 10; // multiply by 10
    console.log(MOON_DIAMETER); // 21591
```

To declare a true constant, use the **const** keyword. As its name implies, **const** makes true constants. If you try to change it, you get an error.

11. Declare a true constant with **const**:

```
    const DOZEN = 12;
    DOZEN = 13; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

12. You cannot change a const, so it gives you an error. Comment it out:

```
    // DOZEN = 13;
```

13. Try redeclaring DOZEN as a **var**:

```
    var DOZEN = 13; // SyntaxError: Identifier DOZEN has already been declared.
```

14. It gives an error, so comment it out.

```
    // var DOZEN = 13;
```
